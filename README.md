## Introduction
This repository contains a Genetic Algorithm implementation developed as part of a university project. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. This project aims to demonstrate how GAs can be applied to solve complex optimization problems.

## Background
Genetic Algorithms are a subset of evolutionary algorithms that use techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution. The main steps in a GA include:
1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of solutions.
2. Selection: Select the fittest individuals for reproduction.
3. Crossover: Combine pairs of individuals to produce offspring.
4. Mutation: Introduce random changes to offspring.
5. Replacement: Form a new population based on fitness.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm.git
cd genetic-algorithm
pip install -r requirements.txt
