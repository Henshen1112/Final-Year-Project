## Introduction
This repository contains a Genetic Algorithm implementation developed as part of a university final year project. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. This project aims to demonstrate how GAs can be applied to solve complex optimization problems.

## Background
Genetic Algorithms are a subset of evolutionary algorithms that use techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution. The main steps in a GA include:
1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of individuals randomly.
2. Selection: Select individuals based on their fitness to reproduce.
3. Crossover: Combine pairs of individuals to produce offspring.
4. Mutation: Introduce random changes to offspring.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of the offspring.
6. Replacement: Form a new population by replacing half of the individuals with offspring.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until a stopping criterion is met.
